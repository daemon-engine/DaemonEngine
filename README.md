## GIT STRATEGY
*master* branch is PRODUCTION branch

*hotfix* branches is made when *master* branch doesn't work, and we need a quickfix! When a *hotfix* branch is complete, and the fix is working, 
then merge into *master* AND *development* branch!

*development* branch is the DEVELOPMENT branch

*feature* branches is branches where the actual development happens!

*feature* branches is created from *development* branch, through Github, and is merged into *development* branch by a Pull Request, through Github.

*bugfix* branches are created from *development* branch, through Github, and is merged back into *development* branch, when the bug is fixed, by Pull Request, through Github.
